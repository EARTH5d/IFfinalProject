    <result xml:space="preserve">After coming back from a war between the Democratic Federation and the Syndicated Consortium, the Humans and the Avisurites, you were shocked to hear that an Anisurite Holdout from the war kidnapped the Crown Princess of the Federation member state Arkonkia. After her family pleads with both the Federation's Senate and the Consortium's Supreme Council to send an expedition force to rescue her. Despite being scarred by the war, and both your own and everyone else's best judgement you feel compelled to volunteer to be part of the mission to save her. Unfortunately, as the ships were just approaching the planet Arkonkian scouts tracked the Princess and her kidnappers to, space pirates attacked the small fleet. The good news you and a few others managed to get on an escape pod. The bad news is that your pod was among many shot by the pirates" ships. This resulted in your pod's engines and its Alcubierre drive being both badly damaged. The Pod crashed upon the planet. To make matters worse, despite the fact you all manage to deploy the parachute, it didn't prevent the pod from ramming into the planet's surface at high speed knocking you unconscious. When you awake, you see that you are the only one to have survived the crash. Furthermore the crash broke the pod's hyperspace communications and you have no idea if any of the other pods have made it. You are on your alone.&#x000A;&#x000A;Not a Fairy Tale&#x000A;An Interactive Fiction by Casey Alton Marshall&#x000A;Release 2 / Serial number 250608 / Inform 7 v10.1.2 / D&#x000A;&#x000A;Crashsite&#x000A;You just outside out of the pod and look around the desert. This is where your escape pod crashed, partily buried in the Sand. You are the only one who survived. You are surrounded by steep sand Dunes in every direction except one. It's just your luck that a few klicks to the north is a towering Avisurite Fort where you just know they are keeping Princess Mabel. Despite the fact it clearly has been abandoned at some point in the recent past, it appears that it has found new habitants. All around you are various kinds of Wildlife including a few different kinds of Plants and those "hawks" flying high above you in the sky. In side of the Crashsite is the escape pod, it's airlock wide open. You can see an Avisurite Fort from here.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see Parachute here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

I really appreciate it and I understand I am the heir to the throne, so everyone would want to be back home safely. But you already fought in the war, shouldn't have put it on yourself to come here to save me. Besides we both know that I am more than Rescuing myself, I am not some Damsel in distress in some fairy tale. In fact I was slowly coming up with a plan to break out of here."&#x000A;&#x000A; "But then what Mabel?" You ask her, "There is nothing but desert for kilometers around.

In fact she wanted to fight in the war too, but she is the heir and you are the spare. That is actually one of the few times that you actually work in your favor.&#x000A;&#x000A; You decided to take some time explaining the entire situation to her.

At first you just assume that it is just a herd of some bioluminescent organisms traveling by, but then Mabel asks, "Is that fire?" And indeed it is. The lights comes closers. It is not long before you can see that the light was being emitted by little tiny torches carried by little rodent-like creatures. They look like something cross between a rabbit, a mouse and a squirrel, have possible thumbs and walk on their hind legs. Along with torches they carried spears, bows and arrows. The one article of clothing they appear to be wearing is pelts and leather wrapped around their bodies and necklace hanging from their neck. They seem to be in their version of the stone age. Galactic laws and treaties strictly limit contact with civilizations that do not have interstellar travel, even more so with ones that appear to barely invent, well anything beyond basic tools. Though by the look of it, you do not have a choice in the matter.</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">One who must be their leader approaches you and Mabel. He look you both up and down. He makes a series of noise that you are pretty sure was him saying something. Whether it was to the two of you or his friends you are not sure. Two more of them approach you, carrying a fur blanket on which there is something round rolling upon as it is carried. They both look younger than most of the rest and you think one is female and the other is male, but to be honest you are not even sure if correct in assuming the first one is their leader or a him or even anything. The "young man" and "lady" set down the blanket they are carrying down in front of you. The object that was carried within it looked exactly like an apple. The three look at you. The leader points his spear at you and speaks again. It seems they are trying to tell you something, but you can not speak their language and they surely will not know any that you or your sister can. But you think they want you to take the "apple". You are not sure if you should, you do not want to break galactic law after all. Perhaps if you and Mabel enter the pod they will get the hint and leave after a while. But maybe you should take the apple. It's probably rude to refuse it. Who knows, they could consider it a great insult worse than any other. You ask Mabel what she thinks. She is not sure herself, but she makes it clear she in favor of taking it.</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">This is the pod's communications, its hyperspace radio transmitter and receiver are both damaged. But, at least the normal radio still works. Too bad the nearest world inhabited by a radio capable civilization is lightyears away. And even then, they have yet to develop a form of practical interplanetary travel much less faster than practical light travel, so it would be both pointless and illegal to try contacting them. You could sit here and try to contact other surivies, but you have a Princess to go try and save. If you are lucky, there are other survivors out there with a working hyperspace radio and are putting it to good uses.&#x000A;&#x000A;normal radio communications is currently switched off.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Even people as far as Andromeda sing its praises. Furthermore the Grues are big fans of the idea of a philosopher king, the fame of his work led him down the path of being elected the Emperor of the Grues. But, sadly his reign was unfortunately cut short after 8 years when he learned the hard way that even a Grue can eat too much. He was 124 Federation standard years old.
