The story title is "Not a Fairy Tale".
The story author is "Casey Alton Marshall".
The story description is "The Princess of the planet Arkonkia has been abducted. Space pirates assault and overrun the Federation's expedition fleet sent to save her. You manage to escape, but your pod crashes and everyone else in there has perished, leaving you alone as if in a desert region of a nearby planet. Fortunately the kidnapper base of operations, where the princess is known to be imprisoned, is only a few kilometers away. But it is not like you can just walk in there and get the princess. Also you have no idea how you two will be getting home."

When play begins: 
	say "After coming back from a war between the Democratic Federation and the Syndicated Consortium, the Humans and the Avisurites, you were shocked to hear that an Anisurite Holdout from the war kidnapped the Crown Princess of the Federation member state Arkonkia. After her family pleads with both the Federation's Senate and the Consortium's Supreme Council to send an expedition force to rescue her. Despite being scarred by the war, and both your own and everyone else's best judgement you feel compelled to volunteer to be part of the mission to save her. Unfortunately, as the ships were just approaching the planet Arkonkian scouts tracked the Princess and her kidnappers to, space pirates attacked the small fleet. The good news you and a few others managed to get on an escape pod. The bad news is that your pod was among many shot by the pirates' ships. This resulted in your pod's engines and its Alcubierre drive being both badly damaged. The Pod crashed upon the planet. To make matters worse, despite the fact you all manage to deploy the parachute, it didn't prevent the pod from ramming into the planet's surface at high speed knocking you unconscious. When you awake, you see that you are the only one to have survived the crash. Furthermore the crash broke the pod's hyperspace communications and you have no idea if any of the other pods have made it. You are on your alone.";

But it's not like you were even going to get it in space again either way. What matter is the hyperspace Communications are broken, but fixed if you can find the rights parts. But at least you can still pick up radio waves in regular space. Though all you get is static and the very faded songs of musicians speaking in languages you can not understand lightyears away and decades ago.[only]". 

Three Sleeping Bags are in the Pod Interior. 

To say communication unit description:

You would try to see if you can get in contact with other surviors, but [if starset is happening] the Princess is right there. You have to go try saving her, even if you kill yourself doing it. You know she would do the save for you[otherwise]if others did survive they probably already sent for help by now if they could. But what if everyone who survived thought that someone else would, then we all would be stuck here for a long time. [first time]Perhaps not long enough to start a new civilization of your own, hopefuly[only][end if].

Too bad the nearest world inhabited by a radio capable civilization is lightyears away. And even then, they have yet to develop a form of practical interplanetary travel much less faster than practical light travel, so it would be both pointless and illegal to try contacting them. You could sit here and try to contact other surivies[if Starset has not ended], but you have a Princess to go try and save. If you are lucky, there are other survivors out there with a working hyperspace radio and are putting it to good uses[end if]."

After you pass with flying colors, you are allowed to clean yourself up and check on your sister. After learning she is in fact doing fine, at least physically, you know that the bulk of the Holdout forces has been rounded up. The ones that have been catched alive will be handed over to the Consortium which will figure out what they want to do with them. The rest are believed to be on the run.
[conditional paragraph break] It takes you and your Sister three days before you manage to get back home. Once there your family threw a small celebration, and pretty much everyone was happy that you both made it home alive.
[paragraph break]Author's note: In case you are wondering whatever happens to The Grue. Well through their mercenary they eventually make enough money to return back to the Grue Home World, where he went on to philosophical treatise that not only change Grue philosophy, but the philosophy of all species, peoples, cultures and civilizations across the local group. Even people as far as Andromeda sing its praises. Furthermore the Grues are big fans of the idea of a philosopher king, the fame of his work led him down the path of being elected the Emperor of the Grues. But, sadly his reign was unfortunately cut short after 8 years when he learned the hard way that even a Grue can eat too much. He was 124 Federation standard years old. Which is old even in Grue terms, just not that old.";

At first you just assume that it is just a herd of some bioluminescent organisms traveling by, but then Mabel asks, 'Is that fire?' And indeed it is. The lights comes closers. It is not long before you can see that the light was being emitted by little tiny torches carried by little rodent-like creatures. They look like something cross between a rabbit, a mouse and a squirrel, have possible thumbs and walk on their hind legs. Along with torches they carried spears, bows and arrows. The one article of clothing they appear to be wearing is pelts and leather wrapped around their bodies and necklace hanging from their neck. They seem to be in their version of the stone age. Galactic laws and treaties strictly limit contact with civilizations that do not have interstellar travel, even more so with ones that appear to barely invent, well anything beyond basic tools. Though by the look of it, you do not have a choice in the matter. One who must be their leader approaches you and Mabel. He look you both up and down. He makes a series of noise that you are pretty sure was him saying something. Whether it was to the two of you or his friends you are not sure. Two more of them approach you, carrying a fur blanket on which there is something round rolling upon as it is carried. They both look younger than most of the rest and you think one is female and the other is male, but to be honest you are not even sure if correct in assuming the first one is their leader or a him or even anything. The 'young man' and 'lady' set down the blanket they are carrying down in front of you. The object that was carried within it looked exactly like an apple. The three look at you. The leader points his spear at you and speaks again. It seems they are trying to tell you something, but you can not speak their language and they surely will not know any that you or your sister can. But you think they want you to take the 'apple'. You are not sure if you should, you do not want to break galactic law after all. Perhaps if you and Mabel enter the pod they will get the hint and leave after a while. But maybe you should take the apple. It's probably rude to refuse it. Who knows, they could consider it a great insult worse than any other. You ask Mabel what she thinks. She is not sure herself, but she makes it clear she in favor of taking it.";

He and the others seem to be trying to tell you and mabel to follow them. You are not sure if that is a good idea. You look at Mabel.

After a half an hour or some, you spot what is unmistakably a camp fire and two crashed espace federation pods. Turns out that you were not the only survivor after all and apparently the natives have correctly assumed that you and them are together. Well, You all are human, so I guess it is not much of an assumption. Though many scientists consider Arkonkians to be their own separate subspecies. But then again these humans are a very diverse bunch. From dark skin with fiery red hair to fair skin with black hair to brown with naturally blue hair and everything in between. But then again, for all they know you and them could not like each other. [paragraph break]Anyway you guys tell the rodent thing thank you and I think they reply with their version of 'Your welcome' and they leave. We spent the rest of the night with the other survivors in their camp and in the Morrying the federation came to rescue us. A federation Space Force patrol squadron lands right next to the camp. A Space Force patrol officer walks down the ramp. You all welcome her and her patrol members to your camp.

You are awakened to the first light of the planet's rising star and the sound of a spaceship zipping through the atmosphere.
