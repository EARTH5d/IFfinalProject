# IFfinaleProject
A Text Adventure  Game/Story I created for my final in a Interactive Fiction Class

Where is the link to play it through the public_html (PSU's public wed directory thing or whatever the proper term is): https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~casmars2/IFfinalProject/docs/NotAFairyTail.html

Might make a new repository for this in GitHub.io later down the road.
